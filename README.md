# Health & Climate Data Insight Pipeline

This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline that explores how climate factors like air pollution correlate with public health outcomes (e.g. asthma rates). It includes data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, modeling, and a Streamlit dashboard.

## 🧰 Objective

- Merge health + climate datasets
- Clean and align time-series or regional data
- Explore relationships through plots
- Build a basic regression or classifier
- Serve insights via Streamlit dashboard

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for dashboard)


## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
